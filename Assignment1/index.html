      <h3>First Attention</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing that stood out was the large, interactive 3D model of
        the Getty Centre, which was the main feature of the experience. The
        model’s dynamic lighting and shading gave it a realistic, almost
        tangible appearance. The subtle motion of the model and its
        responsiveness to mouse movements immediately drew my attention.
        Additionally, the dark background with high-contrast white and orange
        text made the experience feel sleek and modern.
      </p>

      <h3>Discrete Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hovered over the 3D model, noticing how it responded to movement.
        </li>
        <li>Rotated the model by clicking and dragging.</li>
        <li>
          Zoomed in and out using the scroll wheel to examine details up close.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicked on different sections of the model, which highlighted specific
          buildings or architectural elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read pop-up text boxes that appeared after clicking on different
          areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Switched between different views to explore various aspects of the
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scrolled through informational sections to read about Gehry’s
          architectural vision.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicked on the navigation menu to see other available sections of the
          site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Watched embedded media (images and animations) explaining aspects of
          the design process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tried to zoom in further, but found some limits in how close I could
          get.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Most Engaging Part</h3>
      <p>
        I spent the most time interacting with the 3D model, rotating it,
        zooming in, and clicking on different sections. The ability to explore
        the textures, materials, and forms of the Getty Centre in such an
        immersive way made this the most engaging part. The model itself is
        beautifully designed, with lighting effects that highlight depth and
        curvature, which encouraged me to keep exploring from different angles.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Common Action</h3>
      <p>
        The most frequent action was rotating the 3D model to view different
        perspectives of the Getty Centre. This action felt intuitive and
        natural, allowing me to engage deeply with the scale and structure of
        the building. I also frequently zoomed in and out to examine details,
        such as the way light interacts with surfaces.
      </p>

      <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
      <h3>Primary Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The primary goal of the Gehry Getty experience is to educate users about
        Frank Gehry’s architectural design process in an immersive and
        interactive way. Instead of just reading about the Getty Centre, users
        can explore it dynamically, much like they would in a real-world visit.
        The experience aims to make architecture more accessible and engaging by
        letting users interact with the space rather than passively consuming
        information.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication of Goal</h3>
      <p>
        The 3D model and interactive controls clearly communicate that the goal
        is to explore the architecture in depth. Clickable elements and
        interactive prompts guide users to specific architectural details.
        Minimal distractions in the UI keep the focus on the architecture.
        Smooth transitions and hover effects make interactions feel natural. Use
        of storytelling techniques, such as step-by-step explanations of Gehry’s
        design philosophy, enhances the educational aspect.
      </p>

      <h2>Interaction Over Time</h2>
      <h3>Expected Interaction Duration</h3>
      <p>
        This experience is designed for short but repeated visits. A user may
        initially explore the 3D model, then return later to dive deeper into
        specific sections. The way the content is structured encourages
        exploration at one’s own pace, rather than consuming everything in a
        single session. It also has a timeless quality, meaning it could remain
        relevant and engaging over months or even years.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication of Expected Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        The modular layout encourages users to explore different sections
        independently. The interactive elements don’t demand a linear path,
        allowing users to return whenever they like. The experience doesn’t
        overwhelm with excessive information at once, suggesting that users can
        take their time. The polished, high-quality visuals make it something
        users would likely revisit out of interest.
      </p>

      <h2>Media References</h2>
      <h3>Referenced Media</h3>
      <p>
        The experience references digital architectural visualisation and 3D
        modelling techniques used in architecture and design. It also evokes the
        feel of museum exhibits and VR tours.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication of Actions</h3>
      <p>
        The reference suggests that users should interact with the model as an
        exploration tool, focusing on design details.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication of Emotions</h3>
      <p>
        Users should feel engaged and curious, discovering the thoughtfulness of
        the design.
      </p>

      <h2>Interaction Evaluation</h2>
      <h3>Most Frustrating Part</h3>
      <p>
        Zooming in and out can be slow or imprecise, making it difficult to
        focus on small details.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Satisfying Part</h3>
      <p>
        Exploring the textures and materials up close is very rewarding and
        immersive.
      </p>
