        <h2>Interaction Experience</h2>
        <h3>1. First Attention</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that caught my attention was the dynamic 3D model of
          the Getty Center, which was the main feature of the experience.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Discrete Actions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hovered over the 3D model to rotate and zoom in.</li>
          <li>
            Clicked on specific sections of the Getty Center to learn more.
          </li>
          <li>Switched between different architectural layers.</li>
          <li>Examined the textures and materials in detail.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Most Engaging Part</h3>
        <p>
          I spent the most time exploring the 3D model, rotating and zooming in
          on the intricate architectural features.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Most Common Action</h3>
        <p>Rotating and zooming the 3D model to examine different angles.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <h3>5. Primary Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The experience aims to engage users in exploring the architectural
          design of the Getty Center through an interactive, immersive 3D model.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Communication of Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The 3D model and interactive controls clearly communicate that the
          goal is to explore the architecture in depth.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Interaction Over Time</h2>
        <h3>7. Expected Interaction Duration</h3>
        <p>
          The experience is designed for short, repeated interactions rather
          than a single long session.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Communication of Expected Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          Visual cues, highlighted sections, and interactive elements suggest
          users should explore at their own pace.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Media References</h2>
        <h3>9. Referenced Media</h3>
        <p>
          The experience references digital architectural visualization and 3D
          modeling techniques used in architecture and design.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Communication of Actions</h3>
        <p>
          The reference suggests that users should interact with the model as an
          exploration tool, focusing on design details.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Communication of Emotions</h3>
        <p>
          Users should feel engaged and curious, discovering the thoughtfulness
          of the design.
        </p>

        <h2>Interaction Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>12. Most Frustrating Part</h3>
        <p>
          Zooming in and out can be slow or imprecise, making it difficult to
          focus on small details.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Most Satisfying Part</h3>
        <p>
          Exploring the textures and materials up close is very rewarding and
          immersive.
